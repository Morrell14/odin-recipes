    <h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
    <p> Everyone <strong> needs </strong> a great everyday Spaghetti Bolognese recipe, and this is mine! 
        The Bolognese Sauce is rich, thick and has beautiful depth of flavour. Itâ€™s 
        perfect for a quick midweek meal but even better if you can simmer it for a 
        couple of hours! Serve it over pasta, stuff into jacket potatoes, make an epic
         Lasagna or Baked Spaghetti Pie!
    </p>
    <h3> INGREDIENTS </h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Ground beef</li>
        <li>Diced tomatoes</li>
        <li>Chicken stock</li>
        <li>Garlic</li>
        <li>Oil</li>
        <li>Oregano</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper</li>
        <li>Tomato paste</li>
        <li>Bay leaves</li>
        <li>Thymes </li>
        <li>Red wine</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>STEPS</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Sweat the onions. In a large Dutch oven (or a large skillet) over medium high heat,
             add 2 tablespoons of olive oil. Add the finely chopped onion, a pinch of salt and cook until softened, 
             about 5-7 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Brown the meat. Add the ground beef and break it up into smaller chunks with a wooden spoon. Allow to cook 
            for a few minutes without stirring to get crispy and brown, then stir with a wooden spoon and cook through 
            (until meat is no longer pink), about 7-8 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add the tomatoes. Once the meat is nicely browned, add the diced tomatoes and tomato paste. Cook, stirring 
            frequently scraping the bottom of the pan, for 5 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add the herbs and liquids, then simmer. Add the garlic, oregano, thyme and bay leaf bundle, salt, pepper, 
            red wine and chicken stock. Give the sauce a stir (making sure to scrape all the browned bits at the bottom) 
            and bring it to a simmer. Reduce the heat to medium-low, cover and let cook 20-25 minutes, stirring occasionally. Give it a taste, and if necessary, season with more salt and pepper.
        </li>
        <li>
            Cook the spaghetti noodles. Meanwhile, bring a large pot of water to a boil and season liberally with salt. Cook spaghetti one minute shy of al dente according to the package directions.
             Reserve 1 cup of the starchy cooking water and drain.
        </li>
        <li>
            Toss! Remove the herb bundle from the sauce and add the cooked spaghetti. Toss it all together, making sure all the pasta is coated with the sauce. At this point, you can adjust the pasta 
            bolognese as needed by adding a few splashes of the reserved pasta cooking water to loosen it up to your desired consistency. Simmer for 1-2 minutes to finish cooking the spaghetti, then remove from the heat.
        </li>
        <li>
            Garnish and Serve. Finish with the fresh basil and Parmesan cheese. Transfer to serving bowls and enjoy!
